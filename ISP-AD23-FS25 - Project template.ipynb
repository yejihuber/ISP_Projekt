    "**What problem are you addressing, and why is it relevant?**     \n",
    "\n",
    "In pharmaceutical manufacturing, especially during the production of pre-filled syringes and similar medical devices, visual inspection for quality control is a mandatory and highly critical step. Currently, this process is carried out manually by trained personnel who inspect each syringe for potential defects such as air bubbles, foreign particles, or missing liquid content.     \n",
    "However, manual inspection poses several challenges: it requires significant training time, is susceptible to human error, and leads to rapid visual fatigue. In real-world operations, inspectors typically need to take a break after 30 minutes of work due to eye strain. Additionally, to maximize production efficiency, manufacturing lines often run continuously—including overnight shifts—which makes it difficult and costly to rely exclusively on human labor.     \n",
    "If this process could be automated, it could address many of these issues: reducing training overhead, minimizing errors, supporting 24/7 operations, and improving overall manufacturing throughput and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What kind of image or signal data are you working with?**     \n",
    "\n",
    "We are working with RGB image data captured via webcam. The dataset includes images of syringes in various conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Reference syringes (usable)     \n",
    "(2) Syringes containing air bubbles      \n",
    "(3) Syringes with foreign objects     \n",
    "(4) Empty syringes     \n",
    "\n",
    "These images are used for both training and evaluating a classification model that determines whether a syringe is usable or defective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the main goal of your processing task?**     \n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of our image processing task is to build an automated system that analyzes real-time images of syringes and determines whether each one meets usability criteria. By comparing the live input to reference examples using computer vision techniques, the system should be able to detect visual anomalies such as air bubbles, contamination, or missing liquid. Ultimately, the goal is to support or replace human inspection in pharmaceutical quality control—ensuring consistent accuracy while enabling \n",
